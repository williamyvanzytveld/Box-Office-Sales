# Predicting Box Office Sales
In this report, I use data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tmdb-box-office-prediction) and mirror code from [Saba Tavoosi](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tavoosi/predicting-box-office-revenue-with-random-forest).

Using supervised learning, the model learns from the data set provided by Kaggle. Concerns and Complements are expressed in the following report with accompanying visuals.
