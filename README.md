Predicting Movie Box Office Sales with Predictive Analytics
# Predicting Box Office Sales
In this report, I use data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tmdb-box-office-prediction) and mirror code from [Saba Tavoosi](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tavoosi/predicting-box-office-revenue-with-random-forest). A linear regression model, decision tree, and two random forest models of varying fine tuning have been used and evaluated to predict box office sales for movies. Using supervised learning, the model learns from the data set provided by Kaggle. Concerns and Complements are expressed in the following report with accompanying visuals.

This was completed as part of a final project for INFO 602: Predictive Analytics, taught by Dr. Kenneth Arnold at Calvin University.
